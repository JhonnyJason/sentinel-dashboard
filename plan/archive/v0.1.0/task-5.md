# Task 5
Implement Seasonality Backtesting Summary styles and UI flows

## Details
Automated backtesting for a chosen trade as date to date move that might have happened each historic year is the main feature to be implemented.
Here the User shall select the timeframe from which date to which date he wants to run the backtesting. Here we want to implement the rough flow of this interaction 

- [x] selection of timeframe by the user triggers the backtesting stub (real calculations implemented later) and the UX flows
- [x] UX flows: adjust the UI state (add the backtesting class to the #seasonalityframe, remove the analysing class)
- [x] Style, test and fix the basic UX flows
